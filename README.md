# Scraping the WSB Daily Thread and Streaming to Console

## Overview

This project involves scraping the daily thread from the WallStreetBets (WSB) subreddit
and streaming the content to the console in real-time. The implementation is built using
AsyncIO for asynchronous scraping and is designed as a console-based Reddit live thread.

**Warning:**  
This project is highly hardcoded and may break at any time due to changes in
Reddit's structure, API, or thread formatting.
